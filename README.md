## Overview
---

git clone https://github.com/greezyBob/SortAlgorithmChooser.git
```

## Brief
---
* The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from (Console)
* Decision is given via the command line Console.ReadLine()
* The program will then ask for the length of an array via the command line
* The program should then output:
    1. The unsorted randomly generated array
    2. The algorithm to be used
    3. The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
    4. Time taken
