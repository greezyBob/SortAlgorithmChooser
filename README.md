 # About The Project
 
The sort manager is a console application that conforms to the MVC architecture and provides a basic interface for the purpose of displaying the effectiveness of each sorting algorithm. The user can choose the type of sorting algoritm, for example Merge sort, the length of the array, sorts the array in ascending order and displays the results on screen along with the timer to show the speed of the algorithm.

---
## Overview
---
To get started with this project: 
```
git clone https://github.com/greezyBob/SortAlgorithmChooser.git
```  

---
## Brief
---
* The user is presented with a number of sort algorithms to choose from (Console)
* Decision is given via the command line Console.ReadLine()
* The program will then ask for the length of an array via the command line
* The program should then output:
    1. The unsorted randomly generated array
    2. The algorithm to be used
    3. The sorted array after the algorithm has been executed
    4. Time taken
